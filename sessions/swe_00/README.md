The following describes what we would like you to do before the first session of the course _Analysis, Design and Software Architecture_ on Tuesday, Aug. 30th (10:00).

We would like that you prepare the following four things:

  * [A) Reading](#A-reading)
  * [B) Register accounts](#B-register-accounts)
  * [C) Setup workstation](#C-setup-workstation)
  * [D) Get to know Docker](#D-get-to-know-docker)

In case you have problems with installation of any of the tools, do not despair.
You will have to ask the TAs for help during the first exercise session on Tuesday, Aug. 30th (12:00 - 14:00).
